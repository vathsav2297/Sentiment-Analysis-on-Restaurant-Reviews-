"Just had a meal here -started badly when my driver who came to collect me (nice touch ) criticised my footwear in his car .Didn’t set the tone very well 
The Seafood Chowder came in a tiny bowl ...and had a smattering of fish chunks...in it probably so it could pass the seafood’ label 
In accompaniment with the  soup,  I was also served the half a dozen oysters I ordered which came with no lemon ,just a dish of balsamic vinegar . The oysters (or could they have been scallops (?) as the taste was virtually the same 
The  star attraction of scallops were swimming helplessly in pools of sauce ( ostensibly to hide the blandness of their taste I summised, along with chips and a salad offering 
I wasn’t asked  if I wanted dessert 
Whilst there , a collection order was bungles and some drinks left off the Order -with only myself , another table of two and collection girl , how I’d it possible to get an Order wrong ??
For $78, I was left horribly underwhelmed 
The waiter told me prior to eating that this restaurant was among the best in Auckland ...if that’s the case I’m getting on the plane and going back home 
Wasnt asked if I enjoyed it on paying but the offer to ‘come again’ will fall on deaf ears 
Come on Auckland , u can do better than this sort of Roadside Cafe masquerading as a Restaurant!More",0
"There's no need for social distancing at Level 1.
We were served quickly, the waiter was pleasant. Our meals came quickly as there were not many people in the dining room.

Food was ok but not a place to return to",0
Not the best i'm afraid my order came incorrect. Was disappoint after we heard it was suppose to be a good place. The bonus they get from this review is the staff were friendly. Maybe we''ll have better luck next time...,0
Staying at hotel near airport and already turned in car. They have delivery. Food was delivered quickly. Lamb steak was tough. Potatoes tasted like from a box. Seafood was only OK.,0
"Easy walk from our hotel up to this restaurant, great friendly staff and nice basic yummy food. Nice setting and reasonable prices",0
"It was not a pleasant experience. The chops were only fat, the vegetables were cooked too much and the potatoes were hard and not fresh. A glas of wine contains only very little wine.
Staff are nice.",0
The menu was at our hotel and was close by. I had a lamb stir fry which tasted & looked like the sauce was gravy. Not nice.,0

"Despite being misled that this venue was not open we were pleasantly surprised to find them open when we came out for dinner.  Fabulous staff, great food. Hubby could cut his steak with standard knife,  no steak knife required.  I had the greek chicken...Omg something...yummy and different.  Would recommend if you,  like us, stuck near airport for early flight next day, come here for dinner!!!!More",1
"A great place to relax and enjoy their food.Price is very reasonable and the service is great there .Thanks to Bobby.

We ate here last night. The menu is extensive and the staff are friendly. I had the lamb shank which was super tender and a good size. Hubby had a chicken stir fry which was nice and big and very tasty. It was an easy...walk from our hotel. I’d eat here again.More,1
"Despite being misled that this venue was not open we were pleasantly surprised to find them open when we came out for dinner.  Fabulous staff, great food. Hubby could cut his steak with standard knife,  no steak knife required.  I had the greek chicken...Omg something...yummy and different.  Would recommend if you,  like us, stuck near airport for early flight next day, come here for dinner!!!!More",1
